As a Vadose zone hydrological scientist and modeller, my principal role in the Soils and Landscape team is to synergise pedology and hydrology. This has led to the development of S-map-Hydro, which provides 3D hydraulic parameters to a wide range of catchment hydrological models. S-map-Hydro is currently being tested and improved in collaboration with NIWA.
Deriving hydraulic parameters from laboratory work is expensive. Therefore, with international collaboration we derive hydraulic properties by using inexpensive/faster methods derived from the principles of physics. This has led to the development of an automatic infiltrometer, enabling our team to abstract more information from cost-effective particle size distribution. 
The models we have developed are programmed using the open-source SoilWater-ToolBox software, which facilitates the comparison and combination of different methods of deriving hydraulic parameters, and computes water fluxes by using physically based hydrological models.
